<h2>Join a Room</h2>
<form id="joinRoomForm">

    <label for="tempKeyField">Temporary Key (6 characters)</label>
    <input type="text" placeholder="a1b2c3" id="tempKeyField" required>

  </fieldset>
</form>

<p>
  A person from the room you wish to join should send you a 6-character
  temporary key. Note that someone can only invite you to a room if they
  are an admin in that room. Do NOT use this to invite your other sessions
  to a room. Instead, go to your account settings and choose to sync your
  other sessions.
