# suthsung
Suthsung (सत्सङ्ग) in Sanskrit could roughly be translated as "meeting with good company".

This is a material design group chat webapp, where all communication is end-to-end encrypted and done completely peer-to-peer, with no data touching any servers and only being communicate directly between chatters and maximum speeds. 

The idea is, like torrent, every chatter has a local copy of the whole chat log. Every time someone updates the log, it'll be synced between all peers in a p2p fashion. So long as one person has the chat log, it'll survive, and can again be distributed to any peers that have the keys to access it. There is no reliance on any server.

Furthermore, all communication is completely end-to-end encrypted, so no middle-man (such as your internet provider) can understand any of the data being sent.

The webapp runs entirely within your browser as client-side javascript that is completely open source (and being hosted/served by Github). No data is being sent to any servers or third parties.

Lastly, the chat client is fully functioned, supporting text, audio, video, gifs, and general files.

This webapp is a project by Ajay Shanker Tripathi (who just wanted a good app for his family group chat and couldn't find one), and is 100% open source and released under BSD 3 Lisence.
